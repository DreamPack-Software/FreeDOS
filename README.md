## About
FreeDOS is a free and open-source operating system that works like the old MS-DOS. Started in 1994, it lets you run old programs, apps, and classic games on modern PCs. People use it for retro gaming, system recovery, and firmware updates. It’s simple, fast, and lightweight.
> 💡 **Note:** You may see some older or newer Laptops or newer SSD/HDD for PC builds with “No OS installed.” In reality, they sometimes come with **FreeDOS pre-installed** as a placeholder operating system!

It's not 32-Bit or 64-Bit. It's 16-Bit!
You can restart  or shutdown by typing "reboot" or "shutdown" and that's it!

- Command-line interface (DOS shell)  
- Classic DOS tools and utilities  
- Support for old DOS programs and games  
- Batch scripting support  
- Free and open-source software

### 1. FreeDOS for everyone
Most users should use this to install FreeDOS. We recommend using a PC emulator or virtual machine to install FreeDOS. If you don't want to install, you can boot the LiveCD to try it out. Install extra programs from the BonusCD.

### 2. FreeDOS for real hardwares
For real hardware
If you want to install FreeDOS on real hardware without a CD-ROM drive, use the FullUSB instead. The LiteUSB installs the same version of FreeDOS, but contains fewer of the extra programs

### 3. FreeDOS for older hardwares
If your system doesn't support booting from the LiveCD, try installing with the LegacyCD. This installs the same FreeDOS 1.4, but uses a different boot method. Use the BonusCD to install the extra programs.

### 4. VMware for classic hardwares
FreeDOS 1.4 includes a floppy-only edition! This edition should run on any original IBM PC system, including the PC, XT, and AT. Provides versions for 720kB, 1.2MB, and 1.44MB floppy disks.
